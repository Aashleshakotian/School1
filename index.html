    <h1>The Alumni's of N.L Dalmia High School</h1>
    <p>The N. L. Dalmia School has an Ex-Studentsâ€™ Association called DESA. Its aim is to continue and strengthen relations between the ex-students and the school. The body meets twice a year. The enthusiastic response of students has been a major force in introducing this alumni body. The get-together gives them an opportunity to come to a common platform, keeping aside their hectic schedules for a while. The meetings and venue also serve as anchorage to the ex-students, what with their flight in diverse directions.</p></div></section>
